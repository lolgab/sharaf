# Sharaf

## Why sharaf?

**Simplicity and ease of use** is the main focus of sharaf.  

It is built on top of [undertow](https://undertow.io/).  
This means you can use some awesome libraries built for undertow, like [pac4j](https://github.com/pac4j/undertow-pac4j) for security and similar.  
Also, you can use undertow's lower level API, to use WebSockets for example.

Sharaf bundles a set of libraries:
- [querson](./querson) for query parameters
- [tupson](https://github.com/sake92/tupson) for JSON
- [formson](./formson) for forms
- [validson](./formson) for validation
- [hepek-components](https://github.com/sake92/hepek) for HTML (with [scalatags](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/scalatags))

There are a bunch of [examples](./examples) to get you started.

## Misc

Why name "sharaf"?  

Å araf means a "screw" in Bosnian, which reminds me of scala spiral logo.
